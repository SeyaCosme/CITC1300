   <h1>Tomb Raider</h1>
   <p> Tomb Raider on PS1 is about Lara Croft, a woman adventurer/explorer, who is on a mission to find a mysterious artifact called the Scion. The game takes you through all these ancient tombs, ruins, and dangerous places around the world. Lara has to solve puzzles, fight wild animals, and face off against enemies while exploring hidden tombs and secret chambers. She also has to deal with some shady characters who want the Scion for themselves. The game was a huge deal back in the day because of its epic platforming, challenging puzzles, and the way it introduced the world to Lara as a strong, iconic character. Plus, the graphics were pretty cool for the time, even if theyre a little blocky now!</p>
